Verbal/spatial interference code and data for Frank et al. (2012), Cog Psych. This code applies only for Experiment 3 (the other two experiments were done with paper/pencil methods). 

The experiments were run with Matlab and Psychtoolbox and may have dependencies to older versions of these; but as of 2014 I believe they should run fine.
